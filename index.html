    <h1 class="title">Christmas Eve Coding</h1>
    <p class="stuff">Merry Christmas Eve, viewers :). I hope you're having a great day, I know I am. After some thought, I have decided to convert the basic css on my blog page to a more material design-friendly style. I think that it has worked very well, and if you have any critisisms, email <span style="color: #00695C;">adiel74540@gmail.com</span>. Anyway, Chrismas Eve last year was problably one of the most suspenseful days of my life. I knew that my parents had bought me the parts to assemble my new computer, which I am using to type this post. This was rather significant, because I had only had a laptop in the past. It was from 2012, and could barely run minecraft, and couldn't watch YouTube videos. Building my computer was one of the best days of my life. I went from an unusable pice of shit, to a god-like gaming machine. This was around the time that I met the Google recruter that I mentioned previously. Once I realized that I needed to understand what people might be talking about at the Google office, I decided to learn a lot more about Java, and C++. I did learn a surprising amount, for a 12 year old, and some of that information is still relevant to me today. Although I don't think that I will be upgrading my PC anytime soon, but if you have enough funds, and time, I suggest that you try building a computer yourself.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Google Code In</h1>
    <p class="stuff">For those who weren't previously aware, Google Code In is a program for pre-university students to learn about open source programming. I am currently participating in my first year of GCI, and I have enjoyed it a lot. I have learned a decent amount of github and git, and virtual machines. I have finished 3 tasks so far, and I am excited to finish my fourth. For my fourth task, I am working with a company called Sugar Labs. From what I have observed, Sugar Labs is responsible for their web-based software, Sugarizer. It is a tool used to teach children about school subjects, such as science and math. I hope to learn more about git/github from working with Sugar Labs. Another cool skill to learn would be to develop for less known programs, such as Sugarizer. I'll post again about the results when the event ends.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Aydens Dumb Ideas</h1>
    <p class="stuff">I realize that having a neocities blog is pretty pointless. Come on, look at all of the other people with blogs here. If you're reading this, you are most likely bored out of your mind at 11:00. Fear not, as I am in the same situation as I write this. You problably dont't care about me, I wouldn't either, but I'm going to feed you this useless information anyway, because why not. My name is Ayden, I am currently a seventh grade middle school student, this blog doesnt count, but I'm pretty good at programming, and I have been for about a year now. Most of my interactions with my friends are over skype or in the hall, if I happen to see them durring passing time.</p>

    <h1 class="title">Google Is Cool</h1>
    <p class="stuff">I have a half day tomorrow, followed by Christmas vacation, so I don't really care if I am sleep deprived. Google is a really fucking cool company. In sixth grade(last year), I applied for a job as a joke, and someone actually responded. All I really knew was HTML and a little bit of Java, but I put that on my stupid little resume. I must have interested the recruter, that I won't name for privacy reasons, because we ended up talking for a few hours in a hangouts chat. After those few hours, it was decided that over February vacation, I would take a tour of the Google office nearest me, which sadly, wasn't the one this person worked at. It was the coolest shit ever. I waked into the office, and there was a person sized android robot thing, that was designed to look like an owl with a graduate hat. By now, you might have figured out that I went to the office in Cambridge, next to MIT. When I talked to the receptionist, I was given a cool badge with my name on it, as well as the date and a google logo, which I still have. The building design was also super cool. A bunch of buildings were connected, and each floor was labled with colored "lines". Each elevator was themed after some kind of public transit. They had a shit ton of food, all for free. The main cafeteria was huge, and again, provided free food. I also got to talk to an engineer there, who gave me some pretty good advice on what programming languages to learn. It's been almost a year since I went now, and I have learned, or at least researched all of them. I didn't stick with all of them though, because I am interested in front end web development, so a few of them weren't really that useful. After that meeting, I talked to some random people, solved a couple of Rubik's Cubes, and eventually had a hangouts call with the nice person that set up the tour for me. It was really cool, and they gave me some free stuff, such as an off-brand lego android robot, a bag, a shirt(with the mid-2015 logo for some reason), a flashlight, a pen, and a notebook. If you ever get a chance to visit a google office, do it. It's really fucking cool.</p>
